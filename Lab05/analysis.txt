To implement the linear search algorithm for the linked list,
an node iterator was used. This simply means that a pointer
was held at the current search location and was incremented
by setting the node equal to the next item on every iteration.
The search is halted when a string match is found by simply
returning '1' to indicate success.

To implement the search algorithm for the dynamic array,
a similar method was employed, however, instead of using
an pointer iterator, I simply used an index to keep trace
of the position of the current item.

The makefile was implemented by by making generic targets
for building object files. A target was then written
with the dependency objects required to link into the executable.

test and mem targets simply ran the executable with different
parameters. The mem target ran the search under valgrind to
verify no memory errors or leaks were detected.

Looking at mem.txt and out.txt, the results look correct as the
"space" word was found in both cases and the invalid word was
marked as not found.
