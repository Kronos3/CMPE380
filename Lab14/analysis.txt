For the un-damped spring, the analytical solution to
the differential equation is proportional to cos(x)

Because our simulation methods will compound the error
overtime, we can see that the velocity of the euler
and RK2 simulations will begin to oscillate to higher
amplitudes. This of course, will cause the position to
raise in amplitude overtime. The relative error between
the simulated position and the true analytic position
can be modeled by the following formula.

             A(t) cos(8t - P(t))
    E(x) =   ------------------
                  cos(8t)
    Let: A(t) Amplitude error
    Let: P(t) Phase error

As the phase error, P(t) begins to accumulate a larger
value, the overall error function E(x) will begin to look
like the tangent function. The amplitude error, A(t) will
cause this tangent function to increase in amplitude. Looking
at the generated spring.png image, we can see that the two
simulations with high error Euler and RK2 will begin to look
like the tangent function further in the simulation.

Because the errors in Euler and RK2 are proportional to h and h^2
respectively we see that the Euler simulation tends to have higher
error in most places when comparing it to the RK2 simulation.

The Euler and RK2 functions will both have high maximum absolute errors
where the errors spike at the function peaks with values of 683.273
and 25.963 respectively. The average error is relatively good for the
RK2 function at 0.005 however the average error for the Euler simulation
is at -6.922!

In regards to RK3 and RK4, errors are quite low with maximum absolute
errors at 0.034 and 0.008 respectively. The average errors are far lower
at 0.001 and -0.000. This is mostly expected because these simulations
have a proportional error of h^3 and h^4 respectively.
